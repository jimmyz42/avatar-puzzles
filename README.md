****Our project uses 360 video in the beginning but due to github's file limit, you would need to seperately import the video to the project.
Here is the link to the video:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KcrLIzF15sAhDuoiGnlXMAvfj71Hpmk6
After importing the video into the project go to the 360Video object in the Astral scene, go to its child called flipped sphere and then place the video into the video clip in the Video Play Component and then drag the OSTAudio Object into the AudioSource at the bottom of the VideoPLayer Component.
